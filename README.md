# Smart-Irrigation-System

This project demonstrates an automatic plant watering system using Arduino, simulated in Tinkercad with block coding. The system monitors soil moisture levels and activates a water pump when the soil is dry, ensuring plants receive adequate water without manual intervention.

**Components Used**

Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that controls the system.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Detects the moisture level in the soil.

Relay Module: Acts as a switch to control the water pump.

Water Pump: Waters the plant when activated.

Connecting Wires: For building the circuit.


**Simulation**
The project is simulated using Tinkercad, an online platform for 3D design and electronics simulation. The block coding feature in Tinkercad is utilized to program the Arduino.

**How It Works**
The soil moisture sensor measures the soil's moisture level.
If the soil is dry, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino.
The Arduino activates the relay module.
The relay module switches on the water pump.
The water pump waters the plant.
Once the soil reaches the desired moisture level, the system stops the pump.

**Block Code**
The system is programmed using block coding in Tinkercad. Below is a representation of the logic:
